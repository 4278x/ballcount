# ballcount
This is a small and simple python project that I was working on for the past two days, it gives out an estimate of the total amount balls you've shot as a tennis player. (if you are one) The program will ask you a few questions, in order to calculate the final result. Please think before answering, if you get a typo, exit the prgram and reopen it, (because I haven't made the code typo-proof yet). Once it recieves a typo, or a single letter, the whole code will mess up. Answer the questions as accurately as you can, so that the final result will be more accurate. 

I coded the text to wait for a few seconds after being printed, so please be patient while answering the questions.

You might want to try it out if you play tennis :)
