# ballcount
This is a small and simple python project that I was working on for the past two days, it gives out an estimate of the total amount balls you've shot as a tennis player. (if you are one) The program will ask you a few questions, in order to calculate the final result. Please think before answering, if you get a typo, exit the prgram and reopen it, (because I haven't made the code typo-proof yet). Once it recieves a typo, or a single letter, the whole code will mess up. Answer the questions as accurately as you can, so that the final result will be more accurate. 

***You need to download Python in order to execute this code. If you prefer not to, you can also use Online Python to run the code, simply copy all the code and paste it on the website. Links down below:

I coded the text to wait for a few seconds after being printed, so please be patient while answering the questions.

You might want to try it out if you play tennis :)
